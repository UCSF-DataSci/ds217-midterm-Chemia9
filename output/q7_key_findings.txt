**Key Findings:**
1. 
Based on these results there are no major skewedness in the data. 
means and medians align. there don't seem to be very large outliers in the different groupings
2. 
we observed that the dropout rate and intervention adherence was consistent 
amongst the different treatment groups, which eliminates bias caused by treatment assignments.
3. 
the cardiovascular disease outcome of the control group in comparison to two 
interventions didn't have a significant difference
